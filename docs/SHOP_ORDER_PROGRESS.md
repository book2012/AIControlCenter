# Non-SMS order workflow progress

Updated: 2026-10-11 (Asia/Seoul). Current completed stage: 2. Next stage: 3.

| Stage | Scope | Status | Evidence / remaining gate |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Woo stock concurrency and exactly-once cancellation primitive | Complete | Synthetic isolated Woo probe passed; fixtures cleaned |
| 2 | Core cancellation guards and ambiguous-outcome reconciliation | Complete in code/test | 111 tests; Chrome checkout regression; actual Woo read-only receipt verification |
| 3 | DEV Telegram commands and customer cancellation presentation | Pending | Cancellation provider must be explicitly composed; customer notices and state display must change together |
| 4 | Return received/inspected restoration | Pending | Return approval must not restore inventory; paid refunds require separate settlement records |
| 5 | Full workflow regression and DEV activation | Pending | Per-stage commits are pushed; current stage-2 code is not deployed |
| 6 | PROD promotion | Pending authorization | Existing PROD Telegram consumer must not be updated implicitly |

## Stage 2 behavior

Unpaid confirmed orders may be cancelled only before shipping. A committed SENDING cancellation record freezes payment and shipping before Woo is called. Successful bound Woo receipts complete CANCELLED. Timeouts or invalid receipts persist UNKNOWN; no automatic write replay is allowed. Explicit reconciliation only reads the existing Woo receipt and verifies order/tag/digest/items/status/reduction flags. Missing proof leaves the order frozen for investigation. Restart and duplicate cancellation preserve the completed receipt. Paid orders are blocked for refund review. No customer or Telegram command is enabled yet.

## Hold / boundaries

SMS is held. Production code/configuration and real customer orders are unchanged. Synthetic Woo probe is DEV only and cleans its own tagged orders/product. The existing original dirty working tree remains preserved.
