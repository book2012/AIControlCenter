# AI Shopping Platform Architecture

## Purpose

AI Shopping Platform is a service domain inside AIControlCenter.

It is not a traditional WordPress shopping site implementation.

## Responsibility Model

### WordPress

- Shopping homepage
- Product presentation
- Category presentation
- Blog
- Landing pages
- CMS

### WooCommerce

- Products
- Orders
- Customers
- Inventory
- Coupons
- Payment and commerce state

### AIControlCenter

- Shopping business logic
- Shopping API
- AI workflows
- Approval policies
- Recommendations
- Pricing analysis
- Automation policies
- Audit status
- Operational validation

### AI Agent

- Product draft generation
- SEO draft generation
- Product description generation
- Category recommendation
- Review summary generation
- Approved update execution

### n8n

- External workflow execution
- Email
- Notifications
- Webhooks
- Scheduled integrations

## Runtime Model

Current runtime: Virtual development environment

Production target: Mac mini M4

The same application code must be used in development and production.

Environment differences must be configuration-only.

## Worker Boundary

Ubuntu remains an infrastructure worker.

Shopping business logic, AI logic and application state must not be
implemented on Ubuntu.

## Safe Update Workflow

AI draft
to policy validation
to human approval
to controlled WooCommerce REST update
to WordPress presentation
to audit event

## Initial Safety Mode

- Read-only
- Approval required
- AI execution disabled
- Automation disabled

                    +-- WordPress and WooCommerce

### URL Separation

- Canonical signing URL: external WordPress URL
- Internal connection URL: localhost WordPress port
- External development UI: http://bokstory.iptime.org:58088
- Internal REST connection: http://127.0.0.1:8088

### Security

- WooCommerce API Key is read-only.
- Secret files are excluded from Git.
- systemd runtime Secret permissions are 600 root:root.
- Production requires a user-owned domain and HTTPS.
- iptime.org CAA policy prevents certificate issuance for the current DDNS hostname.

### WordPress Responsibilities

- User input rendering
- Input sanitization
- API request forwarding
- Short-lived response cache
- HTML and CSS rendering
- Error fallback messages

### Forbidden WordPress Responsibilities

- Product recommendation decisions
- Price calculation
- Inventory policies
- AI provider calls
- Order automation
- Approval workflows

## SHOP-00 Shopping Platform Reprioritization

SHOP-00 is closed.

Repository inventory and regression validation confirmed that the
existing Shopping Platform Foundation and Shopping External Read
Integration are already part of the current branch history.

Existing capabilities designated for reuse:

- WooCommerce external read adapter
- WooCommerce transport and normalization
- WordPress CMS adapter
- normalized product snapshot JSON contracts
- read authorization and deny-by-default policy
- schema validation and drift monitoring
- adapter health monitoring
- nine read-only Shopping API routes
- Orange Coco storefront

The former SHOP-01 WooCommerce Read Adapter scope is therefore
`CLOSED_BY_EXISTING_SRI`.

The first incomplete product capability is:

`SHOP-01_PRODUCT_MANAGEMENT_READ_MODEL_AND_DASHBOARD`

Architecture invariants:

- Storefront and management Dashboard are separate surfaces.
- Dashboard consumes AIControlCenter APIs only.
- Dashboard does not call WooCommerce directly.
- WooCommerce remains the Commerce Engine.
- WordPress remains the CMS.
- AIControlCenter owns business workflow and normalized management
  views.
- SHOP-01 is read-only.
- Product draft, approval and controlled write remain separate tasks.
- No Shopping business logic is placed on Ubuntu.
- Production writes remain `NOT_AUTHORIZED`.


Management read path:

Dashboard
→ AIControlCenter Dashboard API
→ Shopping management read model
→ existing Shopping snapshot queries
→ existing WooCommerce read adapter

The management read model may aggregate and present existing Shopping
contracts but may not become a second source of product truth.

<!-- SHOP-01B-MANAGEMENT-READ-MODEL:BEGIN -->
## SHOP-01B Shopping Management Read Model

SHOP-01B adds a pure read-only application projection for
operator-facing product management data.

The projection consumes the existing `ShoppingService` boundary and
produces deterministic JSON-safe output containing:

- service health
- readiness
- read/write capability state
- adapter integration state
- catalog totals
- in-stock and out-of-stock counts
- inventory quantity totals
- normalized product list fields

The module performs no network calls, persistence, product mutation,
WooCommerce imports or Dashboard registration.

The Product Management Dashboard remains a projection of WooCommerce
truth through AIControlCenter. It is not a second product database.

The next task is `SHOP-01C_DASHBOARD_JSON_INTEGRATION`.
