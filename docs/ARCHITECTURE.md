## AI Shopping Platform Service Layer

Architecture flow:

WordPress
to WooCommerce
to REST API
to AIControlCenter Shopping Domain
to AI Agent, Scheduler, n8n and Notifications

Responsibilities:

- WordPress owns presentation and CMS
- WooCommerce owns commerce data
- AIControlCenter owns business logic
- AI Agent owns content generation tasks
- n8n executes automation workflows

The current development runtime is virtual.

The final production runtime is Mac mini M4.

Ubuntu must not contain Shopping business logic, AI logic or
application state.

## Shopping Storefront Layer

WooCommerce provides Commerce data.

AIControlCenter consumes and normalizes Commerce data through the WooCommerce Adapter.

AIControlCenter exposes Featured, Search, Category, and Product APIs.

The WordPress AI Shopping Storefront Plugin consumes these APIs and renders the external customer-facing page.

No Shopping recommendation, pricing, inventory, AI, or workflow logic is implemented inside WordPress.
