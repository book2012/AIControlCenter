## Shopping Platform M4 History

AI Shopping Platform was introduced as a service layer on top of the completed AI Home Datacenter Platform.

During M4:

- WordPress and WooCommerce were deployed in the Ubuntu virtual validation environment.
- AIControlCenter remained the sole business-logic and orchestration layer.
- WooCommerce was connected through a read-only Adapter.
- External HTTP development access was established through ipTIME DDNS and port forwarding.
- Public TLS using the ipTIME hostname was rejected by the parent-domain CAA policy.
- Production HTTPS was deferred until a user-owned domain is available.
